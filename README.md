# GCTW-Game-1
Girls Code the World Game Setup/Development

Each developer will both be making the game at the same time. This will allow everyone an equal opportunity to learn all aspects of game design rather than giving each person a different component to work on (coding, design, planning). 

We plan to work on each component together. When we are done a component, all branches will be reviewed together and the best revisions will be pulled into the main branch.

Since this is our first time creating a game and using Github as a way to collab, this method may require some updates in the future.
